                      Radheshyam Pemani Bishnoi (1997-2025), widely known as the "Godawan Man of
                      India," was a wildlife conservationist whose life was dedicated to protecting
                      the critically endangered Great Indian Bustard (GIB) and preserving the rich
                      biodiversity of the Thar Desert in Rajasthan, India.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Born into the environmentally conscious Bishnoi community in Dholiya village
                      near Pokhran, Radheshyam embodied their 500-year tradition of wildlife
                      protection from an early age. By 28, he had accomplished what many
                      conservationists strive for in a lifetime—creating water reservoirs across the
                      arid landscape, leading community conservation projects, documenting critical
                      biodiversity data, initiating anti-poaching cases, and rescuing countless
                      injured animals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      His tireless dedication earned him prestigious recognition, including the
                      Sanctuary Wildlife Service Award (2021) under the Young Naturalist Category
                      and appointment as a Mud-on-Boots Project Leader by the Sanctuary Nature
                      Foundation. Tragically, his life was cut short during an anti-poaching mission
                      on May 24, 2025, when his vehicle collided with a truck on National Highway 11
                      near Jaisalmer.

                      This comprehensive documentation chronicles the extraordinary life,

          <div class="content-with-image">
            <div class="content-text">
              <p>
                Born in 1997 in Dholiya village near Pokhran, Rajasthan, Radheshyam was raised in
                the Bishnoi community—a sect founded in the 15th century by Guru Jambheshwar, who
                established 29 principles (bish: 20, noi: 9) for living in harmony with nature.
                Several of these principles are specifically dedicated to protecting trees and
                wildlife, forming the foundation of what is considered the world's first
                environmental religion.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Bishnoi are renowned for their environmental stewardship, most famously
                demonstrated in 1730 when Amrita Devi Bishnoi and 363 others sacrificed their lives
                to protect khejri trees from being cut down by the Maharaja of Jodhpur's men. This
                historic event, known as the Khejarli Massacre, is considered one of the earliest
                recorded instances of environmental activism and inspired the modern Chipko
                movement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Growing up in this tradition, Radheshyam was immersed in a culture that reveres all
                forms of life. The Bishnoi community's practices—such as burying their dead instead
                of cremating them to save trees, providing food and water for wildlife, and
                protecting animals from hunters—shaped his worldview from an early age.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted by Martin Goodman in his book "My Head For A Tree: The Extraordinary Story
                of the Bishnoi, Guardians of Nature" (2025), the community's commitment to
                conservation is not just a practice but a sacred duty passed down through
                generations, creating a lineage of environmental guardians of which Radheshyam
                became a prominent modern representative.

          <h3>Childhood & Formative Years</h3>
                  <p>
                    From his earliest years, Radheshyam displayed an unusual affinity for wildlife. Local
                    accounts describe how, as a child, he would often be found rescuing injured birds and
                    animals, bringing them home to nurse them back to health. His parents, traditional
                    Bishnoi farmers, encouraged this compassion while teaching him the community's
                    environmental principles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Growing up in the harsh environment of the Thar Desert, Radheshyam witnessed firsthand
                    the challenges faced by wildlife in this arid ecosystem. Water scarcity, habitat loss,
                    and human-wildlife conflict were daily realities that shaped his understanding of
                    conservation needs.

                  <p>
                    His formal education at the local village school was supplemented by practical knowledge
                    passed down through generations of Bishnoi conservationists. By his teenage years,
                    Radheshyam had already developed a reputation in neighboring villages as someone who
                    could be called upon when injured wildlife was found.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In an interview with Natasha Rego of Hindustan Times in 2025, Radheshyam reflected on
                    his early attempts at wildlife rescue: "I spent my childhood trying to rescue injured
                    animals. But I could only save few of them." This frustration at his limited ability to
                    help would later drive him to seek formal training in wildlife first aid and
                    rehabilitation.

                  By age 28, Radheshyam had accomplished what many conservationists strive for in a
                  lifetime. His holistic approach to conservation addressed multiple threats facing
                  the Thar Desert ecosystem and its flagship species, the Great Indian Bustard.

                    <h3>Water Reservoirs</h3>
                    <p>
                      Created and maintained over 100 water reservoirs across the Pokhran region,
                      providing critical hydration for wildlife in the arid landscape. These water
                      points were strategically placed along wildlife movement corridors and
                      regularly refilled using his personal truck, even during border tensions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As noted in Natasha Rego's article, "He also helped build over 100 watering
                      holes across the Pokhran region, where chinkara and other wildlife can hydrate
                      in the desert's punishing summer." Sumer Singh, a fellow conservationist,
                      recalled how even during the India-Pakistan conflict, "When Jaisalmer was
                      under a blackout and we were all scared, Bishnoi would go to the DNP every
                      night in his truck, and refill water in the water holes he had dug for the
                      wild animals in the summer."

                    <p>
                      Initiated over 50 anti-poaching cases resulting in approximately 300 arrests.
                      Developed an extensive network of informants including herders and farmers
                      across the Thar Desert, creating an early warning system for poaching
                      activities that threatened endangered species.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      According to Hamza Khan's article in The Indian Express, "He also played a
                      pivotal role in anti-poaching initiatives, providing information that led to
                      the arrest of poaching gangs, apart from being instrumental in registration of
                      several FIRs."

                      Sumit Dookia noted that "Over the last two years, these Godawan Friends have
                      given information on more than 10 poaching cases. These were of the
                      spiny-tailed lizard, chestnut-bellied sandgrouse, Indian fox, and of course,
                      the chinkara."

                    <p>
                      Led the Godawan Community Conservation project, mobilizing local communities
                      to protect the Great Indian Bustard. Conducted awareness programs in over 50
                      villages, transforming potential poachers into conservation allies and
                      creating a grassroots movement for wildlife protection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As described in Azera Parveen Rahman's article, Radheshyam was part of a
                      project where local youth from villages surrounding the Desert National Park
                      were trained as nature guides. This not only provided them with economic
                      benefits but also instilled a sense of pride and ownership towards the GIB,
                      making them guardians of the bird and its habitat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Musa Khan, one of the trained guides, noted: "The training gave us a lot of
                      information about birds and with experience over these last few years, I have
                      learnt even more."

                    <h3>Power Line Advocacy</h3>
                    <p>
                      Campaigned tirelessly for underground power lines to prevent bird collisions,
                      particularly for the GIB which is highly vulnerable due to its poor frontal
                      vision and large size. His dramatic protest in 2016 brought national attention
                      to this issue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Martin Goodman's book documents how "Bishnoi climbed a transmission tower and
                      threatened to jump if the forest department didn't fit reflectors on the
                      electric wires. Below him, a group from his network had gathered to protect
                      the body of a GIB and prevent the forest guard from burying it. The bird,
                      known for its poor vision, had flown into the lines and been electrocuted.
                      Bishnoi had long been campaigning for the lines to be moved underground, or at
                      least be fit with reflectors. His protest had worked."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Radheshyam personally documented and reported four GIB deaths, three of which
                      were caused by collisions with overhead power lines. His advocacy contributed
                      to the Supreme Court's 2021 ruling that high-tension wires in GIB habitat
                      should go underground.

                <h3>National Mourning</h3>
                <p>News of Radheshyam's death reverberated throughout India's conservation community, triggering an outpouring of grief and tributes from government officials, conservationists, and citizens alike.</p>
                <p>Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat expressed his grief on social media, and Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma called the loss "extremely painful." Former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot stated that "his dedication to nature and wildlife will remain unforgettable."</p>
                <p>Sumit Dookia, a wildlife biologist and Radheshyam's mentor, described him as "the flag bearer of the GIB Community Conservation Program and the biggest conservationist of the Great Indian Bustard." In a heartfelt tribute, he wrote: "Last night, we lost our flag bearer of the GIB Community Conservation Program in a fatal road accident. Even up to the last breath, he was with an anti-poaching patrolling team. Radhe Bishnoi, you gone too early my boy. A true martyr."</p>
                <p>Sutirtha Dutta of the Wildlife Institute of India called him "one of the strongest defenders of wildlife in India" and "a voice from within, a man of the soil."</p>
                <p>The entire city of Jaisalmer was described as "inconsolable" by his friend and fellow conservationist Sumer Singh, who said: "I feel like I've lost my own brother. It is a loss we won't recover from anytime soon."</p>
                <blockquote class="memorial-quote">
                  "Radheshyam's demise is a terrible loss for conservation. He has been one of the strongest defenders of wildlife in India and played a critical role in building the support for nature conservation among local people in the Thar. He was a voice from within, a man of the soil."

                <div class="content-with-image">
                  <div class="content-text">
                    <p>Radheshyam Bishnoi's conservation legacy extends far beyond his tragically short life. His work fundamentally transformed how local communities engage with wildlife conservation in the Thar Desert, creating a model of community-based conservation that continues to inspire similar initiatives across India.</p>
                    <p>His most enduring impact was perhaps in changing attitudes toward the Great Indian Bustard. As noted by Sumit Dookia, the nature guides trained through their project began wearing their identity — "hum Godawan ke ilake se hain" (We are from the GIB area) — with pride. This developed a sense of ownership for the bird that continues to drive conservation efforts.</p>
                    <p>The network of informants and community conservationists that Radheshyam built continues to monitor GIB populations, report poaching attempts, and advocate for habitat protection. His water reservoirs still provide critical hydration for wildlife throughout the arid landscape.</p>
                    <p>His documentation of power line collisions and advocacy for underground cables contributed significantly to the Supreme Court's 2021 ruling on the issue, which, though implementation remains incomplete, established a crucial legal precedent for wildlife protection.</p>

                <h3>Padma Shri Campaign</h3>
                <p>Following Radheshyam's death, local communities and conservationists across India launched a campaign requesting the government to honor him with the prestigious Padma Shri Award (posthumous) for his extraordinary contributions to wildlife conservation and ultimate sacrifice.</p>
                <p>The campaign highlights his key achievements:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
                  <li><strong>Water Conservation</strong> - Construction and maintenance of over 100 water ponds at his own expense, providing a lifeline for wildlife in the arid Thar Desert.</li>
                  <li><strong>Anti-Poaching Efforts</strong> - Collaboration with the forest department to conduct over 1,000 raids to curb poaching and illegal activities threatening wildlife.</li>
                  <li><strong>Community Conservation</strong> - Leadership of community-driven initiatives like the Godawan Community Conservation Project, protecting endangered species including the Great Indian Bustard and blackbuck.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The campaign emphasizes how Radheshyam dedicated over 12 years to conservation in the harsh terrain of Rajasthan's western desert, with a hands-on approach that included rescuing injured animals, fighting poachers, and ensuring water availability. His work saved countless animals and inspired others to join environmental preservation efforts.</p>

                  <p><strong>"My Head For A Tree: The Extraordinary Story of the Bishnoi, Guardians of Nature" (2025)</strong> by Martin Goodman</p>
                  <p>This book documents the remarkable 500-year environmental tradition of the Bishnoi community in Rajasthan, India. It features Radheshyam Bishnoi as a modern embodiment of the Bishnoi tradition of sacrifice for nature, chronicling his journey as the "Godawan Man of India" and his tireless efforts to protect the Great Indian Bustard in the Thar Desert.</p>
                  <p>The book highlights Radheshyam's dramatic protest when he climbed a transmission tower and threatened to jump if authorities didn't install reflectors on power lines after a Great Indian Bustard electrocution. Through Radheshyam's story, the book draws parallels between his sacrifice and the historic sacrifice of Amrita Devi Bishnoi, who in 1730 offered her head rather than allow trees to be cut down.</p>

                        While renewable energy is crucial for combating climate change, the rapid
                        expansion of solar and wind farms in the Thar Desert has had unintended
                        consequences for wildlife. Radheshyam documented how these developments were
                        fragmenting critical habitats and creating barriers for wildlife movement.

                      <p>
                        As noted in Priti David's article, "India's RE capacity jumped 286 per cent

                        Energy. And in the last decade but more so in the last 3-4 years, thousands
                        of renewable energy plants – both solar and wind – have been commissioned in
                        this state."

                      <p>
                        Radheshyam observed disturbing impacts: "I have seen pelicans landing on a

                        bird then slips on the glass and its delicate legs are irreversibly

                  <p>
                    The conversion of arid grasslands to agricultural land and renewable energy
                    projects has significantly reduced the habitat available for the GIB and other
                    desert wildlife. Radheshyam documented how irrigation projects like the Indira
                    Gandhi Nahar Project were transforming the landscape.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Wildlife biologist Sumit Dookia noted that "Various government-supported
                    irrigation projects like the canal (Indira Gandhi Nahar) in Jaisalmer and free
                    grazing pastures are shrinking the habitat rapidly."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Radheshyam observed that "The lizards live in hard sandy and gravel soil
                    habitat, which the government considers as a wasteland only suitable for
                    renewable energy projects. Projects in Sanawara, Chanani and Devikot have
                    already destroyed lizard habitat."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The intrusion of development into sacred groves (orans) where all communities
                    insist even a branch cannot be cut, has turned grazing into a game of snakes and
                    ladders – pastoralists can no longer tread a direct path, but instead must go
                    round fences and dodge windmills and their attendant microgrids.

                        Perhaps the most immediate threat to the Great Indian Bustard is collision
                        with overhead power lines. Radheshyam documented multiple GIB deaths due to
                        this cause and became a vocal advocate for underground power lines in
                        critical GIB habitat.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        According to Priti David's article, "Powerlines are killing not just
                        bustards, but a staggering estimated 84,000 birds a year within a 4,200
                        square kilometre area in and around the Desert National Park in Jaisalmer,
                        says a 2018 study by the Wildlife Institute of India. 'Such high mortality
                        rate [of the bustard] is unsustainable for the species and a sure cause of
                        extinction.'"
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The Great Indian Bustard is particularly vulnerable to power line collisions
                        due to its biology. As Radheshyam explained, "The mighty bustard has eyes on
                        the side of its head, and it cannot see dead ahead. So, it either hits the
                        high-tension wire in a head-on collision or tries to swerve at the last
                        minute. But like a trailer truck that can't take sharp turns, the GIB's
                        sudden change of direction is often too late, and some part of its wing or
                        head slams into the wires situated at heights of 30 metres and above."
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        On April 19, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that "in the priority and
                        potential bustard area, where it is found feasible to convert the overhead
                        cables into underground powerlines the same shall be undertaken and
                        completed within a period of one year." However, as Radheshyam documented,
                        implementation of this ruling remained incomplete, with only a few
                        kilometers of lines fitted with bird diverters and virtually none moved
                        underground.

                    <div class="content-text">
                      <p>
                        As a teenager, Radheshyam began actively rescuing injured animals in the desert. His
                        early efforts were driven by instinct and compassion rather than formal training. "I
                        could only save a few of them," he later recalled, which motivated him to seek
                        proper knowledge and techniques.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        During this period, he developed a network of local herders and farmers who would
                        alert him when they encountered injured wildlife. Using a borrowed motorcycle, he
                        would travel to remote locations to provide basic first aid to animals in distress.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        These early experiences highlighted the need for more systematic conservation
                        efforts in the region. Radheshyam began documenting the types of injuries he
                        encountered, noting patterns that pointed to specific threats facing desert
                        wildlife—from vehicle collisions to poaching injuries and dehydration.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        According to Rhett Ayers Butler's tribute in Mongabay, "By his teens, Bishnoi had
                        become a tireless wildlife rescuer. He began by helping injured animals in the
                        desert, learning the delicate art of handling wildlife, especially the Great Indian
                        Bustard (GIB), one of India's most endangered species. But it wasn't enough to
                        simply rescue injured creatures; he became determined to prevent harm before it
                        occurred."

                  <h3>Formal Training (2014-2016)</h3>
                  <p>
                    Recognizing the limitations of his self-taught approach, Radheshyam sought formal
                    training in wildlife rescue and rehabilitation. In 2016, he completed a wildlife first
                    aid course at Machia Biological Park in Jodhpur under the guidance of Dr. Shravan Singh,
                    a veterinarian specializing in desert wildlife.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The training equipped him with essential skills in wildlife first aid, species
                    identification, and rehabilitation techniques specific to the fauna of the Thar Desert.
                    He learned to treat dehydration in desert animals, set fractures, address wounds from
                    poaching attempts, and properly handle various species from delicate birds to larger
                    mammals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr. Shravan Singh later recalled in a tribute: "Radhe Shyam would often bring injured
                    chinkaras, birds, blue bulls, to me on his truck from Pokhran almost 170 kms away,
                    because they did not have such a facility there. His passion for learning wildlife first
                    aid so he could provide immediate treatment to injured animals was remarkable."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This formal education marked a turning point in Radheshyam's conservation journey,
                    transforming his compassionate instincts into professional expertise. Upon returning to
                    his village, he established a small rehabilitation facility in his family home, equipped
                    with basic medical supplies and enclosures for recovering animals.

                  <h3>GIB Conservation Begins (2015-2016)</h3>
                  <div class="content-with-image">
                    <div class="content-text">
                      <p>
                        The pivotal moment in Radheshyam's conservation career came when he met wildlife
                        biologist Sumit Dookia from the ERDS Foundation. Dookia was conducting field surveys
                        for the critically endangered Great Indian Bustard (GIB), whose population had
                        dwindled to fewer than 150 individuals globally, with the Thar Desert being one of
                their last remaining habitats.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to Akanksha Mishra's article in The Print, "When he found out the
                critically endangered nature of GIBs, and how they were indigenous to his home in
                Pokhran, he instantly decided to work on it," said Sumit Dookia, wildlife biologist
                at the Ecology, Rural Development & Sustainability (ERDS) Foundation, which
                Radheshyam was also associated with.
              </p>
              <p>
                Impressed by Radheshyam's knowledge of the local ecosystem and his dedication to
                wildlife, Dookia invited him to join the foundation's efforts to protect the GIB.
                This collaboration introduced Radheshyam to scientific conservation methodologies,
                including population monitoring, habitat assessment, and threat documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Radheshyam quickly became an invaluable asset to the GIB conservation program due to
                his intimate knowledge of the landscape and strong connections with local
                communities. His ability to navigate the complex social and ecological dynamics of
                the region earned him the nickname "Godawan Man of India" (Godawan being the local
                name for the Great Indian Bustard).
